# StudyGroup App - Video Presentation Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello everyone, today I'm presenting the StudyGroup app, a mobile-first platform designed specifically for University of Surrey students. This application addresses a common challenge students face: finding suitable study partners for their modules and coordinating productive study sessions. Based on research indicating that collaborative learning improves academic outcomes by up to 0.5 standard deviations, we've created a comprehensive solution to enhance the university learning experience."

## App Overview (30 seconds)
"StudyGroup is built with React 18 and Firebase, creating a responsive, real-time experience across all devices. The app integrates University of Surrey's course data, interactive maps for finding study locations, and communication tools for effective collaboration. Let me walk you through the key features."

## Demo Walkthrough (5 minutes)

### 1. Authentication & User Profile (45 seconds)
**SHOW:** Login screen and profile setup
"First, let's look at our secure authentication system. Students register with their university email, create a profile with their major, and select their current modules. This information is crucial for our matching algorithm. Notice how the profile page allows students to set their study preferences and academic goals."

### 2. Course & Module Integration (45 seconds)
**SHOW:** Majors and modules browsing interface
"The app includes a comprehensive database of all University of Surrey academic programs and modules, scraped from the university catalog. Here you can see how students can browse through departments, find their specific major, and view all related modules. This data integration ensures students connect with peers in exactly the same courses."

### 3. Creating & Joining Study Groups (60 seconds)
**SHOW:** Group creation interface and group listing
"Creating a study group is straightforward. Students select a module, set a name, description, and specify meeting parameters. They can make groups public or invitation-only. Here's the group discovery interface where students can find relevant groups based on their enrolled modules. Notice the filtering options based on study focus, group size, and meeting frequency."

### 4. Interactive Maps Feature (45 seconds)
**SHOW:** Campus map with study locations
"One of our standout features is this interactive map that displays study locations across campus. Students can see where groups are meeting, check occupancy of study spaces in real-time, and even tag new locations they discover. Let me show you how a student would find and join a study session at the library using the map interface."

### 5. Real-time Chat (45 seconds)
**SHOW:** Group chat interface
"Communication is essential for effective collaboration. Each study group has a dedicated chat channel where members can exchange messages, share files, and coordinate meetings. The chat supports rich media content and maintains message history for reference. Here's how group members might coordinate last-minute study session details."

### 6. Study Timer & Productivity (30 seconds)
**SHOW:** Study timer interface
"To promote effective study habits, we've integrated a Pomodoro-style study timer. Groups can synchronize their study and break intervals, creating accountability. The app tracks study statistics over time, helping students understand their productivity patterns and improve study efficiency."

## Technical Implementation Highlights (30 seconds)
"Behind the intuitive interface lies a robust technical implementation. We've leveraged Firebase for real-time data synchronization, implemented strict security rules to protect user privacy, and created a responsive design that works seamlessly across devices. The codebase follows a component-based architecture with the Context API for state management."

## Alignment with COM3001 Requirements (30 seconds)
"This project directly addresses the COM3001 module requirements by creating a collaborative solution with real-world utility. The application addresses a genuine need within the student community, incorporates research on effective learning practices, and demonstrates professional software engineering principles throughout its development."

## Conclusion & Future Development (45 seconds)
"StudyGroup is already functional with these core features, but we have an ambitious roadmap planned. Future versions will include calendar integration with university timetables, AI study partner matching based on learning styles, and enhanced analytics for tracking academic progress. As demonstrated, the application fulfills the British Computer Society's requirement for creating software with 'potential use to somebody other than the author.'"

"Thank you for watching this demonstration. I welcome any questions about the implementation details or design decisions behind StudyGroup."

## Technical Demonstration Notes
- Ensure the app is preloaded with sample data for a smooth demo
- Have multiple browser windows/tabs ready to demonstrate real-time features
- Prepare a test account with completed profile and group memberships
- Have the map centered on recognizable campus locations
- Demonstrate both mobile and desktop responsive layouts
