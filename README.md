# StudyGroupApp - University of Surrey

A React application that enables University of Surrey students to form study groups based on their modules, share study locations, and connect with peers in real-time.

## Project Context

### Problem Statement

University students often face challenges when trying to find compatible study partners for their modules. Traditional methods like manually arranging study sessions through group chats or social media are inefficient and don't scale well. According to research by Tinto (2000), collaborative learning environments significantly improve academic outcomes and retention rates, yet many students struggle to form effective study groups due to:

- Limited visibility of peers taking the same modules
- Difficulty coordinating compatible schedules
- Challenges finding suitable study spaces on campus
- Inconsistent group communication channels

The StudyGroupApp addresses these barriers by providing a centralized platform specifically designed for University of Surrey students to connect with peers, coordinate study sessions, and enhance their academic experience through structured collaboration.

### Research Background

Multiple studies demonstrate that collaborative learning improves academic outcomes. Research by Johnson & Johnson (2009) indicates that students in structured collaborative environments achieve 0.5 standard deviations higher than individual learners. Similarly, the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE, 2023) shows that peer-to-peer learning activities are among the most effective high-impact educational practices.

At the University of Surrey, the COM3001 module emphasizes the importance of collaborative projects that have "potential use to somebody other than the author" (British Computer Society), making this app particularly relevant to the department's educational goals.

### Project Objectives

## Methodology & Implementation

### Development Approach

This project follows an Agile development methodology with user-centered design principles:

- **User Research**: Conducted surveys with 42 Surrey students to identify key pain points in forming study groups
- **Iterative Development**: Used 2-week sprint cycles with regular feedback from student testers
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works across all devices, with enhanced features on more capable devices
- **Accessibility First**: Designed with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as a baseline requirement

### Technical Architecture

The application uses a modern JAMstack architecture with Firebase as the backend service:

1. **Frontend Layer**: React.js application with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI
2. **API Layer**: Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database, and Cloud Functions
3. **Data Layer**: NoSQL database structure with real-time synchronization

### Data Collection & Processing

The University of Surrey course catalogue data is collected through a custom web scraper, implemented in both JavaScript and Python for flexibility. The data processing pipeline includes:

1. Extraction of course and module information from university websites
2. Normalization and cleansing of data through a standardized JSON schema
3. Loading processed data into Firebase for consumption by the application
4. Regular updates to maintain synchronization with university systems

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, React Router v6, Tailwind CSS (iOS-style UI)
- **Maps**: Google Maps API integration with React
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Functions, Storage)
- **Data Collection**: Web scraper for the University of Surrey course catalogue
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)

### Installation

1. Extract the zip file to your desired location:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   # Right-click the zip file and select "Extract All..."
   
   # MacOS/Linux
   unzip studygroupapp.zip -d ./studygroupapp
   cd studygroupapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   
   # Also install Firebase Functions dependencies
   cd functions
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase use --add
   ```
   
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase and Google Maps config:
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
   ```

### Running the Scraper

To populate the database with the latest course information:

1. Run either Python or JavaScript scraper:
   ```bash
   # JavaScript version
   node scripts/scrapeCatalogue.js
   
   # Python version
   python scripts/fetch_surrey_catalogue.py
   ```
   
   This will create JSON files in the `/data` directory with major and module information.

2. Deploy the data to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions:loadCatalogueData
   ```
   
3. Trigger the cloud function to load the data:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-project-id.web.app/api/loadCatalogueData -H "X-Admin-Key: your-admin-key"
   ```
